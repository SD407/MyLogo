Personal Freelancer WebApplication - MyLogo
-------------------------------------------

I used to work as a graphical designer back in college (it was a hobby of mine).
I didn't have a webpage, and now, as I'm looking back, I'm asking myself how I would've designed it.

And this is what I came up with. 

It provides me with a simple design, to show my potential customers what I can do.
It's easy to use and it provides a way for the them to get in touch with me and to request a commission (e.g a logo, webdesign, poster etc.)

And in doing so, they'll get a nice design and they'll recieve it directly on their account page without the use of other online platforms or storage services.

The application, handles users and commissions made by them.

A user can create (register) his account on the website.
Create a commission and download when it's ready.

There are also page admins and db administrators.
They can create, delete, edit, search users or create, edit, delete, upload and download commissions.
